# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

This project was developed as a Data Analytics portfolio piece. It simulates a real-world business case in which a data analyst explores hotel booking data to uncover factors affecting reservation cancellations and builds a machine learning model to predict them.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to explore a dataset of hotel bookings, identify the main drivers of cancellations, and develop a classification model to predict which bookings are likely to be canceled.  
The dataset includes detailed information on bookings, such as guest demographics, booking channels, reservation dates, and special requests.

**Main questions explored:**
- What percentage of bookings are canceled?
- Which variables are most strongly associated with cancellations?
- How accurately can we predict if a booking will be canceled?

## üß™ Development Process

### Initial Planning
- Defined the objective and success criteria
- Identified relevant features for modeling (lead time, booking changes, room type, market segment, etc.)

### Data Inspection & Cleaning
- Loaded and reviewed 119,390 records
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately
- Converted date columns and created new time-based features

### Exploratory Analysis
- Calculated cancellation rates and examined variable distributions
- Explored relationships between features (e.g., lead time and cancellations)
- Visualized patterns and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

### Feature Engineering & Modeling
- Engineered features from date columns
- One-hot encoded categorical variables
- Built and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict cancellations

## üìä Key Insights

-	The cancellation rate is approximately 37% (about 44,000 out of 119,390 bookings).
-	Bookings with higher lead times are strongly associated with cancellations (as shown in the boxplot: median lead time for canceled bookings is much higher than for non-canceled).
-	The logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 82% and a ROC AUC of 0.89.
-	The model‚Äôs recall for canceled bookings is 68%, meaning it identifies most cancellations but misses some, which is typical for imbalanced datasets.
