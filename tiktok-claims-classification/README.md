# TikTok Claims Classification

Project from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.

Analyzes user engagement (views, likes, shares, comments) in TikTok videos labeled as either "claim" or "opinion." Includes data cleaning, feature creation, and exploratory analysis to support a machine learning model.

**Key highlights:**
- Created engagement metrics per view (`likes_per_view`, `shares_per_view`, `comments_per_view`)
- Found that claim videos have higher engagement than opinion videos
- Banned and under-review users tend to post highly shared content
- Dataset is balanced: ~50% claims, ~50% opinions
